The following is a list of Debian packages that are needed to run each module:

core:
    python3-apsw
    python3-requests
    python3-colorama
    python3-humanize        # currently only used in notify module but I might use it more

aggregator:
    python3-lxml
    python3-oauth2client

serial:
    python3-serial

medialib:
    #python3-mutagen
    python-kaa-metadata     # ok... I switched to kaa even though it's python2 only atm, because it handles many more formats more
                            # easily, and kaa comes with a command line program `mminfo`, which is what the code actually uses

xmms2:
    python-xmmsclient       # on debian, this is currently only available for python2.  The xmms2cli submodule uses the command
                            # line program to communicate with a running xmms2 instance
