The following is a list of Debian packages that are needed to run each module:

everything:
    python3-apsw
    python3-requests

aggregator:
    python3-lxml

serial:
    python3-serial

medialib:
    #python3-mutagen
    python-kaa-metadata     # ok... I switched to kaa even though it's python2 only atm, because it handles many more formats more
                            # easily, and kaa comes with a command like, mminfo, which is what the code actually uses

xmms2:
    python-xmmsclient
