 
Nerve is a web-based integration framework with a similar MVC architecture to CodeIgniter, but implemented in python3.  It's primarily used as a home automation server and media player/media library.  Nerve has a modular structure, which makes it easy to extend and customize, and the generic widgets and devices system which makes it easier to tie together many different hardware devices, sensors, and internet information sources into one place (or across distributed servers).  The major weakness of nerve at the moment is its security.
