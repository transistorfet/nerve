* fix the message return... (xmms2 in particular just sends all song name updates to the last IP that it received a message from)

* add intensity changes to RGB daisywire control
* fix RGBNode to control daisy downstream device when receiving serial commands

* add a _default function or something that allows more dynamic extensions of devices (eg. layout.livingroom looks for a file,
  layouts/livingroom.xml)
 
* add an auto discovery feature where the phone sends a broadcast message to the default port number and the servers respond (pretty
  much normally).

POSSIBLE FEATURES:
	* you could add a mechanism for registering for 'push notifications' by something like rgb.* <- wildcard so that all rgb
	  messages would be automatically sent to that endpoint
