* add a _default function or something that allows more dynamic extensions of
  devices (eg. layout.livingroom looks for a file, layouts/livingroom.xml)
 
* add an auto discovery feature where the phone sends a broadcast message to
  the default port number and the servers respond (pretty much normally).

POSSIBLE FEATURES:
	* add a winamp volume control (might be best with feedback)
	* display the currently playing song

	* add RGB LED control

	* you could add a mechanism for registering for 'push notifications' by something like rgb.* <- wildcard so that all rgb messages would be automatically sent to that endpoint
